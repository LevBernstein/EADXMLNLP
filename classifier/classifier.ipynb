automated systems office dating from the early 1980s, have also been placed in storage with the central services division. although there are some items related to the marc pilot project, the marc system, and the marc development office, most of these files deal with the automation efforts taking place before marc or outside the scope of marc. office files from processing services department that contained materials about automation of technical processing, activities and projects of the marc development office (which was a unit under processing services), and activities of ansi z39.

comarc pilot project or the marc formats (including the bibliographic codes and character sets and the liaison with users) that had been the responsibility of the marc development office. in addition, materials from more recent efforts, such as the network advisory committee, network technical architecture group, linked systems project, national level bibliographic record documents, network data base design project, or international marc projects (including the work done by the british in the late 1960s), have been included, as well as numerous publications about or by library network

lenore s. maruyama, maruyama associates, inc., arlington, va. the finding aid was revised in 1989 and 2017. this collection is arranged in fourteen series: arranged in three subseries: automated
